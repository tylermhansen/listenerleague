### A Brief Poem

../../uploads/Tavern+Loop+One+-+320bit.mp3?autoplay=1&loop=1&controls=0

To destroyeth a home league, <br>
one needeth not be as cunning as thee. <br>
Listen now with great intrigue, <br>
as I tell you the legend of one who is _definitely_ not me.

--- 

That gent is a mere twenty-two now, <br>
which may be younger than thou, <br>
but he understands thine movie references. &#128253;


He writes code for AI at a game studio, <br>
but is chiller than that Gibson, Antsnownio, <br>
for a draft order, he has no preferences. &#127847;

The memes he doth provide to Slack, <br>
are only rivaled by his famous Talk of the Smack, <br>
and his name is Tyler Hansen. &#9997;

Thou must be careful if he recieveth an invite, <br>
because his fantasy teams have been known to fight, <br>
and to the championship round he'll be dancin'. &#127926;
