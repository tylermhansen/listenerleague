### A Brief Poem

<p>
To destroyeth a home league, <br>
one needeth not be as cunning as thee. <br>
Listen now with great intrigue, <br>
as I tell you the legend of one who is <i>definitely</i> not me.
</p>

<p>
That gent is a mere twenty-two now, <br>
Which may be younger than thou,
But he understands thine movie references.
</p>

<p>
He programs AI at a Game Studio, <br>
and is chiller than that Gibson, Antsnownio,
for a draft order, he has no preferences. 
</p>

<p>
The memes he doth provide to Slack <br>
Are only rivaled by his famous Talk of the Smack 
</p>
